# INTRODUCTION 


The first chapter gives an overview of the online application "NSTU Dynamic Website with Integrated Chatbot" created a modern online platform that embodies the vibrant spirit and endless possibilities offered by our renown university. It provides us many sections from where users can know about any small details about NSTU, like about Cyber centeristration, about academic information, admission related information, notice board from where users get update frequently, besides users can get updated news and events. From integrated chatbot we can get answers by asking which is reply to us in static way. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to understand user queries and provide relevant responses or perform actions. In this Website has Cyber center panel were Cyber center plays Cyber center role. Rather Cyber center can add teachers as a moderator to edit their personal profile. This chatbot receives questions from users, tries to understand the question, and provides appropriate answers. Our dynamic website serves as a reflection of our commitment to providing a cutting-edge educational environment where students, faculty, staff, and visitors can seamlessly connect, engage, and explore. It does this by converting Bangla and English sentence into a machines-friendly query, then going through relevant data to find the necessary information and finally returning the answer in a natural language sentence. In other words, it answers your questions like a human does, instead of giving you the list of websites that may contain the answer. For example, it will receive the question “IIT means?”, it will give a response “IIT Stands for Institute of Information Technology”. The goal is to provide chatbot for users a quick and easy way to have their questions answered. 

NSTU Dynamic Website with Integrated Chatbot will help to know any information related with NSTU. It can provide quick and accessible support to students, rather than chatbot give the answers to their frequently asked questions. This website gives every update about Cyber centeristration, academic, admission, notice, news and events and also research. If users need any answers by asking questions so they can ask questions in chatbot, it will provide proper answer. Here Cyber center panel can edit and update everything they want, Cyber center also give a email and password for teachers log in such that they can join as a moderator. Edit and updated section will handle by the Cyber center panel. The website and chatbot are available 24/7, you just need to visit the site and access the site. This section tries to familiarize readers with the project's overview, purpose and scope.
